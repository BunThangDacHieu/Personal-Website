                <p>Gothic architecture is an architectural style that was prevalent in Europe from the late 12th to the
                    16th
                    century, during the High and Late Middle Ages, surviving into the 17th and 18th centuries in some
                    areas.[1] It evolved from Romanesque architecture and was succeeded by Renaissance architecture. It
                    originated in the Île-de-France and Picardy regions of northern France. The style at the time was
                    sometimes known as opus Francigenum (lit. 'French work');[2] the term Gothic was first applied
                    contemptuously during the later Renaissance, by those ambitious to revive the architecture of
                    classical
                    antiquity.</p>
